Efficient-Computation-of-Lighting
=================================

This bachelor's thesis deals with efficient computation of lighting in graphics scenes containing many light sources. Basic lighting calculation techniques as well as techniques derived from them will be introduced. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate tiled shading and its optimizations described more in detail in both theoretical and practical sections. Concluding part consists of experiments performed on this techniques measuring their efficiency as well as implementation details of some interesting or important parts of them.
