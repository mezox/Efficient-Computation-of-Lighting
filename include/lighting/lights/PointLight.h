Project information
---------------------
The goal of this project is to efficiently compute lighting in scenes
with hundrends to thousands light sources. To handle this there have been
implemented lighting techniques as deferred shading, tiled deferred shading
and tiled forward shading. Application requires GPU supporting OpenGL 3.3+
but may be compatible with older versions. Application logic was implemented
using C/C++ with some external helper libraries to handle basic operations.
